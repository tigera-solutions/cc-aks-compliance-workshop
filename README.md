# Microsoft AKS Security Bootcamp: <br> Achieving PCI, SOC2, HIPAA, NIST and GDPR compliance for containerized applications

## Welcome

In this AKS-focused workshop, you will work with Azure and Calico Cloud to learn how to design and deploy best practices to achieve compliance with regulatory frameworks such as PCI, SOC2, HIPAA and others and secure your Kubernetes environment. 

Enterprises developing compliant cloud-native applications have two primary needs. First, they must secure and govern access to containerized workloads and the Kubernetes environment. Second, they need to simplify audit logging and compliance reporting. The Kubernetes environment is dynamic and distributed, and workloads are ephemeral, making enforcing compliance controls and providing continuous reporting difficult.

The purpose of this repository is to offer you a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on creating an Azure AKS cluster, registering it on Calico Cloud, and securing your cloud-native applications to meet compliance requirements. Although Calico Cloud provides a wide range of functionalities and security features, this workshop will concentrate on a few key features that effectively ensure compliance across multiple regulatory frameworks due to time constraints. If you would like to delve deeper into this topic, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## Time Requeriments

The estimated time to complete this workshop is 60-90 minutes.

## Target Audience

- Cloud Professionals
- DevSecOps Professional
- Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)
- Solutions Architects
- Anyone interested in Calico Cloud :)

## Learning Objectives

Learn how to:
- **Scan container images** and **block deployment** based on your security criteria during build time.
- Preview and **enforce security policies** to protect vulnerable workloads.
- Implement **zero-trust access controls** to prevent egress and lateral movement during runtime.
- Implement **runtime security** with IDS/IPS, WAF, and malware detection.
- Get **visibility** into Kubernetes cluster traffic to **troubleshoot** and **improve security**.

## Workshop Environment Preparation

> :warning: **For this workshop, you are expected to have access to a previously created AKS cluster.**

- Please, follow the instructions on the repository below if you don't have it ready: 

  [Calico Cloud on AKS - Workshop Environment Preparation](https://github.com/tigera-solutions/aks-workshop-prep)

- We will run this workshop from the Azure Cloud Shell, as described in that repository.

- To start your cluster, reload the environment variables create in your Azure Cloud Shell first and then start the cluster. Use the following command:

  ```bash
  source ~/workshopvars.env
  az aks start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTERNAME
  ```

## Modules

This workshop is organized in sequencial modules. One module will build up on top of the previous module, so please, follow the order as proposed below.

Module 1 - [Connect the AKS cluster to Calico Cloud](/mod/module-1-connect-calicocloud.md)  
Module 2 - [Scan Container Images](/mod/module-2-scan-images.md)  
Module 3 - [Calico Cloud Admission Controller](/mod/module-3-admission-controller.md)  
Module 4 - [Security Guardrails for Network-based Threats](/mod/module-4-security-guardrails.md)  
Module 5 - [Configuring IDS protection and Workload-Centric WAF](/mod/module-5-ids-waf.md)  
Module 6 - [Quarantine Infected Workloads and KSPM](/mod/module-6-quarantine-kspm.md)  
Module 7 - [Clean up](/mod/module-7-clean-up.md)
